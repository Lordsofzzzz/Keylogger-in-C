# ðŸ”‘ Keylogger in C

## ðŸ“Œ Description
This project is a simple **keylogger** implemented in C using the **Windows API**. It captures keystrokes and logs them to a file (`log.txt`). The program runs in the background without a visible console window.

## âš¡ Features
- âœ… **Logs all keystrokes**, including special keys (Enter, Backspace, Shift, etc.).
- âœ… **Timestamps each keystroke** for better tracking.
- âœ… **Runs in the background** by hiding the console window.
- âœ… **Optimized file handling** (log file remains open to reduce I/O overhead).
- âœ… **Closes log file properly on exit** to prevent corruption.

## ðŸš€ How to Compile & Run
### **ðŸ”¹ Compilation**
Use **MinGW** or any C compiler supporting the Windows API:
```sh
gcc keylogger.c -o keylogger.exe -mwindows
```
The `-mwindows` flag prevents a console window from appearing.

### **ðŸ”¹ Running the Keylogger**
Simply execute:
```sh
keylogger.exe
```
The keylogs will be stored in `log.txt`.

## ðŸ”’ Disclaimer
This project is for **educational purposes only**. Unauthorized use of keyloggers to capture user input without consent is **illegal**. Use this project **only for ethical hacking, penetration testing, and cybersecurity learning**.

## ðŸ›  Future Enhancements
- ðŸ”¹ Encrypt log file to enhance security.
- ðŸ”¹ Send logs remotely via email or a server.
- ðŸ”¹ Add stealth techniques to bypass detection.
